# This repository is to record all the work of assignments from the COMP9414 -- AI
# The assignment1 is first committed and visualized with sourcetree and transfered to github later, and because of reorganization of directories, all the changes cannot be seen directly. However, they are still seeable if you click the comments.

# The first assignment is asking us to write some functions to solve five specific problems in prolog.
# The fourth one is a bit hard.
# Prolog is somehow interesting!
